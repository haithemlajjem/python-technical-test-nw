# Python Technical Test

This project is a FastAPI web service for managing **Sites** and **Groups**. Sites represent energy installations, and Groups help organize them. The app supports full CRUD operations, applies some business rules, and is designed to handle country-specific fields, making it easy to extend in the future.

---

## Features

### Models
- **Site**
  - Supports country-specific fields (`useful_energy_at_1_megawatt` for France, `efficiency` for Italy).
  - Includes power capacities and installation metadata.
- **Group**
  - Can include multiple Sites or other Groups.
  - Includes type classification (`group1`, `group2`, `group3`).

### Relationships
- Many-to-Many: Sites â†” Groups  
- Hierarchical: Groups â†” Child Groups

## ðŸ”§ Business Rules

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| France | Only **one** French site can be installed **per day** |
| Italy  | Italian sites **must be installed on weekends** |
| Group3 Restriction | Sites **cannot** be associated with groups of type **group3** |
